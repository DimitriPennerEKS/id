# Self-Registration Space (aka Sandbox)

This is the sub-namespace serving the self-registration of ADMIN-SHELL-IO identifiers. Everyone can independently add identifiers here, as long as the have not been used by others.

Pull Requests only affecting this directory will be accepted without any in depth evaluation and as quick as possible. Note that identifiers in this sub-namespace might change/be erased without further notification and at any time.
